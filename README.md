# Nihility

This is game engine made from scratch, winner of my college's capstone invitational. I've made my own data structures, memory allocator, and math library. I try to get as low level as possible by making my own file stream, using Raw Input, and job system. This engine is currently going through a major refactor (Refactor branch) to make it more easily expandible.
